## Waterloo-Assignment 

This repository gives the solution of the problem: Learning the behavior of projectile based on data.

The submission file is: submission.csv (result from Ridge Regression)

###LIBRARIES FOR PRODUCING THIS FILE:

1. Python 2.7

2. sklearn libraries for Python

3. pandas libraries 

4. numpy libraries

5. matplotlib libraries

6. Jupyter Notebook (OPTIONAL)

###STEPS FOR PRODUCING THIS FILE:

1. Pull the repository (or download) to local computer

2. Using command line, cd to the downloaded folder

3. After having Python and assiciated libraries installed, type: py Assignment.py

4. The resulted file is: submission.csv

###OTHER FILES:

1. Assignment.ipynb : a python notebook with the same code as the Assignment.py but this file contains some visualization and the comment is easier to follow (can be used for generate the submission.csv - require Jupyter Notebook installed). This file can be viewed on the repository.

2. CSV_format_generated.m: a matlab m file for generating the Data.csv and Groundtruth.csv file

3. Data.csv: Data file which is transformed from projectile.csv (original dataset) for training our model

4. Groundtruth.csv: Data file with compute the trajectory of the projectile being thrown with v = 10m/s and angle = 45 degree (using Physics Law).

5. projectile.csv: Original dataset
